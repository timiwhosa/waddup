        <h2>10 things to do so as to pass Futa Post-Utme</h2>
        <div class="intro">
            Every year, around june, july, Futa releases its Post-Utme form for students to obtain. Futa also provide similar Post-Utme questions in form of past questions for its applicants so as to facilitate student reading process 
            and ensure that students read that which is required. <br>
            Now, what am going to explain below, applies not only to Post-Utme alone but generally to  a student's life and academics. <br>
            We have other write up that talk specifically about Post-Utme and other issues <a href="#other-post">here</a>
        </div>
        <div class="con">
            Moving on to the 10 things you need to do, a word of advise is that you study/pay attention to each point, as they are all unique and altogether important.
        </div>

            <div class="point point4">
                <h3>No1:Set a target for yourself </h3>
                <p>
                    Don't just say you want to pass futa Post-Utme, Every other applicant wants to pass also. Who wants to fail before? <br>
                    Instead, say "I want to score so so so in my Post-Utme and this is how i will do it". Thank God you have the <a href="/postutme/calculator">Post utme calculator</a> to help you know the minimum you must have in your post utme based on your jamb score. <br>
                    You don't need to score everything, doesn't mean you should fail or you should relax. Know the <a href="/postutme/calculator">minimum you must score in your post utme based on your jamb score</a>, and set goals; It makes it easier.
                    <br> When you set goals, you know exactly what you have to do, what you have done and what you haven't. As such, You end up saving time (instead of thinking on what to do), you will achieve more and with less stress
                </p> 
            </div>

            <div class="point point2">
                <h3>No 2: You need Strategic Reading (and read with understanding)</h3>
                <p>
                    By Strategic reading, I don't just mean opening your book and covering all the subjects (it's cool, but not the best). Make use of past-questions, attend tutorials, ask questions, interact with people.
                    <br>Rest regularly, and have breaks between reading time. Don't over work yourself. <br> A wise man is one who wants to achieve something and sits down to know the requirements. Break your subjects into smaller components and 
                    read accordingly. No need to read all night and also, "Know what works best for your". What time do you read and assimulate well, etc.
                    <br> Ask your self questions about the subject or topic you are reading, read according to the target you set for your self.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="point point3">
                <h3>No3: Believe in yourself (Motivate your self)</h3>
                <p>Generally, the attitude or mindset you take to an exam determines your performance in that exam. <br>
                    Remember how jamb used to look tough and hard (before the exam)? How do you see it now? Same applies to any exam, the moment you are done with it, you see it like its easy. You have to be confident and not allow doubt to destroy your goal. <br>
                    Remember, its once a year.... if you miss this one, its till next year o. When your friends will be saying am in 200lvl, what will you say?... ask yourself that. 
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="point point4">
                <h3>No4: Avoid bad Energy</h3>
                <p>
                    Examples of bad energy are; People who say Futa Post-Utme is hard, those that want to cheat instead of reading, people who are scared of tomorrow, People who feel they can't get their desired course. <br>
                    Instead, surround your self with brilliant minds, those who know about the challenge (Exam) and are willing to conquer it no matter what. <br>  
                    Ask your self these question; those in Futa, How many head do they have? Are they smarter than me? Am i worthless? ok am worthless, how did i now get to this level in life? so many people have dropped out, Why haven't I?.. <br>
                    In summary, YOU ARE THE BEST for what ever you hope to achieve. Success Dear!!
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="point point5">
                <h3>No5: Ask questions</h3>
                <p>We can't know it all. There is always someone that knows more than we do, so ask for help. Not clear about something? ask for help. Don't know how to get a particular thing, like <a href="/archive/section/postutme">Past-questions</a>,etc. Ask for help. You can also <a href="/contact">contact us</a> and don't forget that this is the right time to mix with brilliant minds.
                <br> Remember that all that matters is you gaining admission, as no one cares about the pain you went through. Every one just wants to see what you achieved. So do what you must, by joining groups for futa Post-Utme, interacting intelligently, etc.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="point point4">
                <h3>No6: Don't Pity Yourself or Put little Energy (give your best)</h3>
                <p>
                    A wise man once said, and i quote " <i>I Never saw a wild thing sorry for itself..</i>" Do you know what that means? Maybe you don't, let me explain; 
                    <br> A lion(wild thing) may try to kill/catch an animal when hungry, and it may fail to do so, but does it ever stop hunting? No it Doesn't!! Same goes for you as a student, God has helped you thus far, don't let self pity destroy you. Read as much as you can (Strategically), Don't pity yourself, Forget your family background because it's about survival of the fittest.. Show them.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="point point4">
                <h3>No7:The three D's </h3>
                <h5>Decision Determines Destiny</h5>
                <p>
                    What's your reason for choosing that course. Are you there for the money or for the fact that it's your passion and you hope to help, change lives and solve problems. Remember it's for 5years and Eternity.
                    Be sure your are not going to be angry for the next five (5) years. If it is your passion, then be determined to make it and the rest is left to God. <br>
                    Make the right decision, be determined and see how beautiful your destiny will be.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="point point4">
                <h3>No8: Always read and understand the question you are asked </h3> 
                <p>
                    This is a very important one. Most times we are carried away by how simple the questions are or how short the time is, that we end up answering questions wrongly. Take a look at the example below:
                </p>
                    <div class="imgg"><img src="/blog/postutme/img/q1.png" alt="futa-postutme-question" srcset=""> <img src="/blog/postutme/img/q2.png" alt="futa-postutme-question" srcset="">
                    <span>Nearest in meaning,  </span>
                    <span>opposite in meaning </span>
                    </div>
                <p>
                     Futa Post-Utme works just like our  <a href="/cbt/postutme">CBT section</a>. The questions are chosen randomly and sent to your screen. Now the questions in those images might be your Question 1 and 2 or any number, and what most students do is that they just answer without stopping to read the questions (If you take a closer look, both questions look similar). Majorly because of time or whatever,
                    students end up answereing both thesame way, forgetting that you are not marked based on how many you answered, but based on how many questions you got correctly and every question you miss, means you've lost 4MARKS.... 4 good marks. <br>
                    You don't have to answer everything to score high, but you must answer as many as possible "correctly" to have a good percentage and meet your <a href="/blog/postutme/futa-departmental-cut-off">Department cut-off point</a>. <br> Take time to read and understand the question before answering 
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="point point4">
                <h3>No9: Leave tough/unclear/difficuly questions and answer simplier one's (Be fast) </h3> 
                <p>
                    A lot of time, we end up spending much time and energy on questions that we don't understand, or we know but don't seem to get it at the moment, forgetting that all questions carry equal marks. 
                    <br>You don't know the answer to a particular question?  leave it and move to other one's because focusing on it and not getting it will not only waste your time but will also reduce your comportment and confidence in the exam, also do not pick any option so that it will allow you to know later, the one's you have not answered and easily identify the one's you've skipped. <br>
                     If you've used our <a href="/cbt/postutme">CBT section</a>, you'll notice that if you move to another question without answering the previous, the number will remain white, but if you pick an answer, it will change to blue. Same applies in Futa Post-Utme and cbt generally and for you to
                     easily know the one you left, do not pick any answer. Or you note the number to that question in a piece of paper.
                     <br>
                     Note that this applies generally to all exams you'll write both in Futa and anywhere. Time is always of the esssence, and you can't waste it on one question. Move to simplier one's and you might even see the answer to the hard one while solving others. It's also funny , the way the brain works. Instead of just focusing on one question, by the time you move to other questions, the brain will now be focused on the other questions and at the same  time finding solution to the hard question you left. In summary, You will be able to answer more questions, finish on time and have better grades... Be wise.
                </p>

            <div class="point point4">
                <h3>No10: GOD </h3> 
                <p>
                    Yes God. Pray always. Haven't you heard of people who fall sick before/ during exams? <br>
                    God is everything. Never stop to communicate with him and be sure you have a good relationship with him. You are alive for a reason and for a purpose <br>
                    Play your part and leave the rest to him.
